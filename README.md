# PAC-ResNet
The core implementation of PAC-ResNet

## Environment

The code was developed and tested with the following environment:

- Python 3.8
- PyTorch 2.3.1 (CUDA 11.8, cuDNN 8.7.0)
- CUDA Toolkit 11.8
- pandas 2.0.3
- numpy 1.24.3

## ▶️ Run the Code

To run the main script:

```bash
python run.py

## 📂 Data

The original dataset contains sensitive information and is not publicly available due to privacy and legal restrictions.  

> 🔒 We are unable to share the raw or processed data upon request.

That said, the implementation is modular. You can:
- Replace the data loader with your own dataset
- Use the same model architecture on similar tasks
- Refer to `run.py` and `dataset/` (if exists) for expected input format
